# Mailchimp Newsletter Integration Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the Mailchimp newsletter integration for the Million Dollar Blueprint website.

## Overview

The integration allows visitors to subscribe to your newsletter directly from the website. When they submit their email, it's automatically added to your Mailchimp audience list.

## Prerequisites

- A Mailchimp account (free tier works fine)
- Access to the GitHub repository
- Vercel account (for deployment)

## Step 1: Get Your Mailchimp Credentials

### 1.1 Get Your API Key

1. Log in to your Mailchimp account
2. Go to **Account** → **Extras** → **API keys**
3. Or visit directly: https://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/
4. Click **Create A Key**
5. Give it a descriptive name like "million-dollar-blueprint-website"
6. Copy the API key (it will look like: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-us20`)

### 1.2 Get Your API Server

The API server is the part after the dash in your API key. For example:
- If your API key is `abc123...xyz-us20`, your server is `us20`
- If your API key is `abc123...xyz-us21`, your server is `us21`

### 1.3 Get Your Audience ID

1. Go to **Audience** → **All contacts**
2. Click **Settings** → **Audience name and defaults**
3. Look for **Audience ID** (it will be a string like `a1b2c3d4e5`)
4. Copy this ID

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

### For Local Development

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your credentials:
   ```env
   MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER=us20
   MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID=your_actual_audience_id_here
   ```

3. Save the file (it's already in .gitignore, so it won't be committed)

### For Vercel Deployment

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add the following three variables:
   - **Name:** `MAILCHIMP_API_KEY`
     - **Value:** Your Mailchimp API key
   - **Name:** `MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER`
     - **Value:** Your server (e.g., `us20`)
   - **Name:** `MAILCHIMP_AUDIENCE_ID`
     - **Value:** Your Audience ID

4. Make sure to add them for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

## Step 3: Test the Integration

### Local Testing

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
4. Scroll to the newsletter section
5. Enter a test email and click "Get Free Training"
6. You should see a success message
7. Check your Mailchimp audience to verify the email was added

### Production Testing

1. After deploying to Vercel, visit your live site
2. Test the newsletter signup form
3. Verify the email appears in your Mailchimp audience

## Step 4: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Mailchimp newsletter integration"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy the changes.

## Features Implemented

✅ **API Route**: `/app/api/subscribe/route.ts` handles newsletter subscriptions
✅ **Form Integration**: Newsletter form on homepage connects to Mailchimp
✅ **Error Handling**: Handles duplicate emails and network errors gracefully
✅ **Loading States**: Shows "Subscribing..." while processing
✅ **Success/Error Messages**: Clear feedback to users
✅ **Email Validation**: Built-in HTML5 email validation
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

## Troubleshooting

### "Server configuration error"
- Check that all three environment variables are set correctly
- Verify there are no extra spaces in the values
- Redeploy after adding environment variables in Vercel

### "Member Exists"
- This email is already subscribed to your list
- This is expected behavior for duplicate subscriptions

### "Network error"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API key is valid and not expired
- Check Mailchimp service status

### Emails not appearing in Mailchimp
1. Check the correct Audience ID is being used
2. Look in **Audience** → **All contacts** → **View contacts** → **Subscribed**
3. Check if emails are going to "Pending" (requires double opt-in confirmation)

## Mailchimp Settings Recommendations

### Double Opt-In (Recommended)

By default, the integration uses `status: 'subscribed'` which adds emails directly. For GDPR compliance and better email deliverability, consider enabling double opt-in:

1. Go to **Audience** → **Settings** → **Audience name and defaults**
2. Enable **Enable double opt-in**
3. Customize the confirmation email

### Welcome Email

Set up an automated welcome email:
1. Go to **Audience** → **Signup forms** → **Form builder**
2. Enable and customize the welcome email

## Security Notes

- ✅ API keys are stored as environment variables (never in code)
- ✅ `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (never committed)
- ✅ API route runs server-side (API key never exposed to browser)
- ✅ Basic authentication is used for Mailchimp API
